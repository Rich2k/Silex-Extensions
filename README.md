Silex-Extensions
=================

This used to be a repo of Silex extensions for various services. They've since been split into their own repositories. If you really need the files, they're available on the master branch (so it doesn't break things for too many people hopefully). I recommend using the individual repositories though:

* [Assetic](https://github.com/mheap/Silex-Assetic)
* [Embedly](https://github.com/mheap/Silex-Embedly)
* [Gravatar](https://github.com/mheap/Silex-Gravatar)
* [Mandango](https://github.com/mheap/Silex-Mandango)
* [Markdown](https://github.com/mheap/Silex-Markdown)
* [Memcache(d)](https://github.com/mheap/Silex-Memcache)
* [MongoDB](https://github.com/mheap/Silex-Mongo)
